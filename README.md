# My Portfolio

## Describtion

This is my first portfolio from scratch. Using what I learned from class and on my own, I was able to put together a very basic version on what I would consider a professional profile.

## Usage

This profile will serve as a projection of my achievements and progressesion on my path to code.
Positioning of objects is one of the tough challenges in creating my portfolio and will need to brush up more on.

## Forward

I look forward to upgrading and working on my profile in the future
